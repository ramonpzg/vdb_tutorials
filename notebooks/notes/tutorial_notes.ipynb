    "\n",
    "In its most widely-used form, recommendation systems work by analyzing data about you and other users. The system looks at your previous choices, such as movies you've watched, products you've bought, or articles you've read, and it then compares this information with data from other people who have similar tastes or interests. These systems are used in various companies such as Netflix, Amazon, Tik-Tok, and Spotify. They aim to personalize your experience, save you time searching for things you might like, or introduce you to new and relevant content that you may not have discovered otherwise.\n",

    "The method is straightforward to implement via the `client.recommend()` method, and it provides enough flexibility that the logic on how the feedback gets capture can rest in the hands of the developers at your organization.
