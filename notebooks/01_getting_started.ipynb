    "- The first is that when we initiated our docker image, we created a local directory called, `qdrant_storage`, and this is where all of our collections, plus their metadata, will be saved at. Qdrant can use one of two options for [storage](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/storage/), **in-memory** storage (which stores all vectors in RAM and has the highest speed since disk access is required only for persistence), or **memmap** storage (which creates a virtual address space associated with the file on disk). You can have a look at that directory in a *nix system with `tree qdrant_storage -L 2`, and something similar to the following output should come up for you.\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "- The second is that we used `client.recreate_collection()` and this command, as the name implies, can be used more than once to create new collections with or without the same name, so be careful no to recreate a collection that you did not intend to recreate. To create a brand new collection that cannot be recreated again, we would use `client.create_collection()` method instead.\n",

The system looks at your previous choices, such as movies you've watched, products you've bought, or articles you've read, and it then compares this information with data from other people who have similar tastes or interests. These systems are used in various companies such as Netflix, Amazon, Tik-Tok, and Spotify.

    "To wrap up, we have explored a bit of the fascinating world of vector databases, and we learned that these databases provide efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional vectors, making them ideal for similarity-based search tasks and recommendation systems. Both of these use cases can be applied in a variety of industries while helping us unlock new levels of information retrieval. In particular, recommendation systems built with Qdrant provide developers with enough flexibility to add and subtract data points that users liked or dislike, respectively, and even set up a threshold for how similar a recommendation must be before our applications can serve it.\n",
